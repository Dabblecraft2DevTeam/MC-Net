MC-Net
======

MC-Net is a Bukkit plugin designed to add computers to Minecraft!
This plugin is very much in alpha. I do not recommend installing it on public servers.
The MC-Net API is free to use, just provide a link to the source and do not take credit for it.
I'm fine with you using the API, but do not say the API is yours!
I'm rather lenient when it comes to things like this, and I like APIs that are free to use as much as the next guy,
but like him, I do not tolerate taking absolute credit for something that isn't yours. Please be cool about this!
